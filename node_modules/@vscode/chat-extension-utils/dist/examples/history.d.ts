/**
 * Including conversation history in your prompt is important as it allows the
 * user to ask followup questions to previous messages. However, you want to
 * make sure its priority is treated appropriately because history can
 * grow very large over time.
 *
 * We've found that the pattern which makes the most sense is usually to prioritize, in order:
 *
 * 1. The base prompt instructions, then
 * 1. The current user query, then
 * 1. The last couple turns of chat history, then
 * 1. Any supporting data, then
 * 1. As much of the remaining history as you can fit.
 *
 * For this reason, we split the history in two parts in the prompt, where
 * recent prompt turns are prioritized above general contextual information.
